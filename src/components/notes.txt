 useCallback hook is used when you have a component in which the child is rerendering again and again without need.

 useMemo hook is used to save the data into cache memory, so that if a costly function or anything with same params
 is initiated during rerendering, useMemo will directly pick the value from the cache memory instead of running it 
 again while re rendering
